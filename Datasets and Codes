FROM customers
JOIN orders ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;

-- 3. Retrieve the top 3 best selling books based on the total quantity sold
SELECT title, author, genre, SUM(quantity) AS Total_quantity_sold 
FROM books
JOIN order_items ON books.book_id = order_items.book_id
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY Total_quantity_sold DESC 
LIMIT 3;

-- 4. Find the average price of books in the fiction genre

SELECT CONCAT('$', SUM(p.price * q.quantity)) AS Total_revenue 
FROM books p
JOIN order_items q ON p.book_id = q.book_id;

-- 7. Retrieve the books with titles containing the word "and"
SELECT title 
FROM books
WHERE title LIKE '%and%';

-- 8. Find the customers who have placed orders worth more than $50
SELECT name, order_id, CONCAT('$', total_amount) AS orders_above_50 
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
WHERE total_amount > 50
GROUP BY total_amount;

-- 9. Retrieve the book titles and their corresponding authors sorted in alphabetical order by author
SELECT title, author 
FROM books
ORDER BY author ASC;

-- 10. Find the customers who have not placed any orders
SELECT c.name AS Customer_info, order_id, order_date 
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE order_id IS NULL
GROUP BY name;
```
